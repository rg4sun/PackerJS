/* NOTE:
 * Since your are writing your site in a "old-fashion" way (html,css,js three-piece suit),
 * you should import your dependencies in html file using <script> tag rather in this js file, such as:
 * `<script src="https://YOUR-CDN.com/dependencies-path"><\/script>`
 * PackerJS allow you do this by modifying template.html.
 * See line 13("customize your dependencies") in template.html.
 *
 * If you are using Vue-like modern web frameworks, then PackerJS is too low to use(no such need for PackerJS)
